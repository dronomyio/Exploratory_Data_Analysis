pdf("EuStocks.pdf", width = 6, height = 5)plot(EuStockMarkets)graphics.off()will send a pdf file to the working directory and the width and height parametersallow one to control the size and aspect ratio of the plot.Problem 1 Write a brief description of the time series plots of the four indices.Do the series look stationary? Do the fluctuations in the series seem tobe of constant size? If not, describe how the volatility fluctuates.Next, run the following R code to compute and plot the log returns on theindices.logR = diff(log(EuStockMarkets))plot(logR)Problem 2 Write a brief description of the time series plots of the four seriesof log returns. Do the series look stationary? Do the fluctuations in the seriesseem to be of constant size? If not, describe how the volatility fluctuates.In R, data can be stored as a data frame, which does not assume that thedata are in time order and would be appropriate, for example, with crosssectionaldata. To appreciate how plot() works on a data frame rather thanon a multivariate time series, run the following code. You will be plotting thesame data as before, but they will be plotted in a different way.plot(as.data.frame(logR))Run the code that follows to create normal plots of the four indices and totest each for normality using the Shapiroâ€“Wilk test. You should understandwhat each line of code does.par(mfrow=c(2, 2))for(i in colnames(logR)){qqnorm(logR[ ,i], datax = T, main = i)qqline(logR[ ,i], datax = T)print(shapiro.test(logR[ ,i]))}
