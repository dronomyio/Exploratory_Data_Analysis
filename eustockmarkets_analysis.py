Problem 1 Analysis:
The time series plots of the four European stock indices (DAX, SMI, CAC, FTSE) show the following characteristics:

1. Stationarity: None of the series appear to be stationary. All four indices show clear upward trends over time, 
   particularly after 1995, indicating non-stationarity in the mean. This is typical of stock market indices over 
   long periods, reflecting general economic growth and inflation.

2. Volatility: The fluctuations in the series do not appear to be of constant size. The volatility seems to 
   increase as the index values increase, which is a common phenomenon in financial time series known as 
   volatility clustering. Specifically:
   
   - All indices show relatively lower volatility in the early years (1991-1995) compared to later years.
   - There appears to be a period of higher volatility around 1997-1998, possibly related to the Asian 
     financial crisis.
   - The DAX index seems to exhibit the most pronounced increase in volatility over time.
   - The relationship between the level of the indices and their volatility suggests that log returns 
     might be more appropriate for analysis than raw returns.

3. Co-movement: All four indices appear to move together to some extent, suggesting correlation between 
   European markets, though each has its own distinct pattern.

Problem 2 Analysis:
The time series plots of the log returns for the four European stock indices show the following characteristics:

1. Stationarity: The log returns appear to be much more stationary than the original price series. The mean 
   of the log returns seems to be consistently around zero for all indices, with no obvious trends. This is 
   a typical characteristic of financial returns and suggests that the log transformation has addressed the 
   non-stationarity in the mean that was present in the original price series.

2. Volatility: The fluctuations in the log returns do not appear to be of constant size over time. There is 
   clear evidence of volatility clustering, where periods of high volatility are followed by more high volatility, 
   and periods of low volatility are followed by more low volatility. Specifically:
   
   - All indices show periods of relatively calm markets interspersed with periods of higher volatility.
   - There appears to be increased volatility around 1997-1998, likely corresponding to the Asian financial crisis.
   - The volatility seems to be more constant in magnitude compared to the original series, but still exhibits 
     time-varying characteristics.
   - This time-varying volatility suggests that GARCH-type models might be appropriate for modeling these returns.

3. Extreme values: All series show occasional extreme returns (both positive and negative), which appear as 
   spikes in the time series plots. These extreme returns are more frequent than would be expected under a 
   normal distribution, suggesting heavy-tailed distributions.

4. Mean-reversion: The log returns show a tendency to revert to the mean (around zero), which is consistent 
   with the efficient market hypothesis in its weak form.

Normality Analysis:
The normal Q-Q plots and Shapiro-Wilk test results for the log returns of the four European stock indices show:

1. Q-Q Plots: All four indices show deviations from the straight line that would indicate perfect normality. 
   Specifically:
   
   - The tails of the distributions (both upper and lower) deviate from the straight line, indicating heavier 
     tails than a normal distribution.
   - This heavy-tail behavior is consistent across all four indices and is a common characteristic of financial 
     returns.
   - The heavy tails suggest that extreme events (large positive or negative returns) occur more frequently 
     than would be predicted by a normal distribution.

2. Shapiro-Wilk Test: The Shapiro-Wilk test formally tests the null hypothesis that the data comes from a 
   normally distributed population. For all four indices:
   
   - The p-values are extremely small (much less than 0.05), leading to rejection of the null hypothesis.
   - This confirms that the log returns are not normally distributed.
   - The test statistics (W) are all less than 1, with values further from 1 indicating stronger evidence 
     against normality.

3. Implications: The non-normality of these returns has important implications for financial modeling and risk 
   management:
   
   - Models assuming normality (like traditional mean-variance optimization) may underestimate the risk of 
     extreme events.
   - Alternative distributions like the Student's t-distribution or stable distributions might provide better fits.
   - Risk measures that account for heavy tails (like Expected Shortfall) may be more appropriate than those 
     assuming normality (like Value-at-Risk with normal assumptions).

Comprehensive Analysis of European Stock Indices (1991-1998):

1. Price Series Characteristics:
   - All four indices (DAX, SMI, CAC, FTSE) show strong upward trends, particularly after 1995.
   - The series are non-stationary with increasing volatility over time.
   - There appears to be co-movement among the indices, suggesting correlation between European markets.

2. Log Returns Characteristics:
   - The log returns appear to be stationary with means close to zero.
   - Volatility clustering is evident, with periods of high volatility followed by more high volatility.
   - Increased volatility is observed around 1997-1998, possibly related to the Asian financial crisis.

3. Distributional Properties:
   - All log return series exhibit non-normal distributions, as confirmed by both visual inspection (Q-Q plots) 
     and formal testing (Shapiro-Wilk test).
   - The distributions have heavier tails than normal distributions, indicating a higher probability of extreme returns.
   - The summary statistics show excess kurtosis for all indices, further confirming the heavy-tailed nature of the returns.

4. Implications for Financial Modeling:
   - The non-normality of returns suggests that models assuming normality may underestimate risk.
   - The time-varying volatility indicates that GARCH-type models might be appropriate for volatility modeling.
   - The heavy tails suggest that risk measures accounting for extreme events should be preferred.
   - The correlation between indices suggests potential benefits from international diversification, but also 
     indicates that these markets may be affected by common systematic factors.

This analysis provides a foundation for more sophisticated modeling approaches, such as multivariate GARCH models, 
copula-based dependence modeling, or regime-switching models that could capture the changing dynamics of these markets.
