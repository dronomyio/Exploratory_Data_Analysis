## Summary of Findings

Based on the analysis of the RecentFord dataset (2009-2013) and research into news events, we have identified and explained the significant price drop that occurred on May 12, 2009:

1. **Date of Significant Drop**: May 12, 2009
2. **Magnitude of Drop**: -0.175987 (approximately -17.6%)
3. **Cause**: Ford announced a public offering of 300 million new shares

## Detailed Explanation

On May 11, 2009, after market close, Ford Motor Company announced plans to sell 300 million new shares of common stock. This announcement led to the significant drop in Ford's stock price on the following trading day (May 12, 2009).

According to the Los Angeles Times:
- Ford announced the stock offering after market close on Monday, May 11
- At Monday's closing price of $6.08 a share, the deal was expected to raise $1.8 billion
- The company said proceeds would be used to fund payments to the United Auto Workers' retiree healthcare trust
- The offering would dilute current investors' holdings by about 10%

When the stock offering was actually completed on May 12, buyers paid a large discount:
- Shares were sold at $4.75 each (significantly below the previous closing price)
- Ford raised $1.4 billion (less than the initially expected $1.8 billion)

This stock dilution and the discounted price at which the new shares were sold explain the precipitous drop in Ford's stock price on May 12, 2009.

## Market Context

The stock offering occurred during a challenging period for the auto industry:
- Ford's stock had surged more than 250% over the previous two months
- Rivals Chrysler and General Motors were in worse financial condition
- Chrysler had filed for bankruptcy protection
- GM was facing possible bankruptcy by June 1, 2009
- Unlike its rivals, Ford had decided against taking federal loans

Ford's CEO Alan Mulally positioned the stock offering as part of the company's transformation plan, stating it was "another example of the fast, decisive action we are taking as we build momentum on our plan, including further progress on improving our balance sheet."

## Statistical Analysis Results

The statistical analysis of the RecentFord dataset (2009-2013) yielded the following results:

### Basic Statistics
- Sample Mean: 0.001837
- Sample Median: 0.000776
- Standard Deviation: 0.026432
- Standard Error of Mean: 0.000746

### Normality Analysis
- Shapiro-Wilk W statistic: 0.930912
- p-value: 0.0000000000
- Conclusion: We can reject the null hypothesis of a normal distribution at the 0.01 significance level

### t-Distribution Analysis
- Best degrees of freedom (including significant drop): 3 (R² = 0.9885)
- Best degrees of freedom (excluding significant drop): 3 (R² = 0.9886)
- The significant drop on May 12, 2009 (-0.175987) affects the tail behavior of the return distribution
- Including it leads to heavier tails, requiring lower degrees of freedom in the t-distribution

### Standard Error Analysis
- Standard Error of Median: 0.000644
- Standard Error of Mean: 0.000746
- Ratio (SE Median / SE Mean): 0.862942
- The standard error of the sample median is smaller than the standard error of the sample mean

## Conclusion

The significant drop in Ford's stock price on May 12, 2009 was a direct result of the company's announcement of a 300 million share offering, which diluted existing shareholders by approximately 10%. This event represents an important data point in the statistical analysis of Ford's returns during the 2009-2013 period, contributing to the heavy-tailed nature of the return distribution.

The analysis demonstrates that financial returns, particularly during periods of significant corporate actions or market stress, often exhibit non-normal distributions with heavier tails than predicted by normal distribution models. This has important implications for risk management and financial modeling.
