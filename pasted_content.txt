1. This problem uses the data set ford.csv on the book’s web site. Thedata were taken from the ford.s data set in R’s fEcofin package. Thispackage is no longer on CRAN. This data set contains 2000 daily Fordreturns from January 2, 1984, to December 31, 1991.(a) Find the sample mean, sample median, and standard deviation of theFord returns.(b) Create a normal plot of the Ford returns. Do the returns look normallydistributed? If not, how do they differ from being normallydistributed?(c) Test for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test? What is the p-value?Can you reject the null hypothesis of a normal distribution at 0.01?(d) Create several t-plots of the Ford returns using a number of choicesof the degrees of freedom parameter (df). What value of df gives aplot that is as linear as possible? The returns include the return onBlack Monday, October 19, 1987. Discuss whether or not to ignorethat return when looking for the best choices of df.(e) Find the standard error of the sample median using formula (4.3) withthe sample median as the estimate of F−1(0.5) and a KDE to estimatef. Is the standard error of the sample median larger or smallerthan the standard error of the sample mean?
